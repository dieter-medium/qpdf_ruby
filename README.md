# QpdfRuby

> **Patchâ€¯&â€¯polish PDFs so that PACâ€¯2024 finally turns green.**

QpdfRuby is a very small Ruby wrapper around the battleâ€‘tested
[QPDF \>= 12](https://qpdf.sourceforge.net/) C++ library.  Right now the
library focuses on only **three specialised tasks** that are needed when
PDFs are printed from Chromiumâ€‘based browsers and subsequently audited
with the PACâ€¯2024 accessibility checker:

1. **Export the structure tree as XML** â€“ handy for debugging.
2. **Mark vector path objects as `/Artifact`** so that decorative lines,
   boxes, &c. are ignored by assistive technologies.
3. **Add missing `/BBox` entries to every `/Figure` element** (derived
   from the pageâ€™s graphic operators) so that screen readers know the
   physical extent of each image.

Together these tweaks eliminate the most common complaints PAC 2024 has
about browserâ€‘generated PDFs.

## Features in Detail

| Feature                                        | Ruby API                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Dump structure tree as XML                     | `doc.show_structure`                     |
| Mark path objects ( `re â€¦ S/s/f/F/B/b` )       | `doc.mark_paths_as_artifacts`            |
| Ensure `/Figure` elements have a layout BBoxÂ¹  | `doc.ensure_bbox`                        |

_Â¹Internally the gem parses each pageâ€™s content stream, maps image
`/MCID`s to their transformation matrix, computes the bounding box
(courtesy of a little linear algebra) and finally writes the result into
the structure tree._

## Installation

### Requirements

* **Ruby** \>= 3.1
* **QPDF** \>= 12.0.0 (headers & libs)

### macOS
```bash
brew install qpdf
bundle config set --local build.qpdf_ruby "--with-qpdf-dir=$(brew --prefix qpdf)"
```  

### Debian/Ubuntu
```bash
# on Debian 11/Ubuntu 20.04 you may need newer packages from testing
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y libqpdf-dev qpdf
```
If `apt` cannot provide QPDF â‰¥ 12 you can compile it yourself or pull the
package from *testing/unstable* â€“ see the [Dockerfile](./docker/Dockerfile) for a working
`apt preferences` snippet.

### Add the gem
```bash
bundle add qpdf_ruby
# â€¦or without bundler:
# gem install qpdf_ruby -- --with-qpdf-include=/usr/local/include/qpdf --with-qpdf-lib=/usr/local/lib
```

---

## Quick Start
```ruby
require "qpdf_ruby"

pdf = QpdfRuby::Document.new("input.pdf")

# 1. tag decorative paths
pdf.mark_paths_as_artifacts

# 2. add BBox to every <Figure>
pdf.ensure_bbox

# 3. introspect structure tree (optional)
File.write("structure.xml", pdf.show_structure)

# 4. save ðŸŽ‰
pdf.write("fixed.pdf")
```

Run PAC 2024 on `fixed.pdf` â€“ it should report far fewer (or zero!)
errors compared to the original browser output.

---

## Development
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dieter-medium/qpdf_ruby.git
cd qpdf_ruby
bin/setup        # install gem + test deps
autotest         # guard & RSpec
```
* Bump **version.rb** â†’ `bundle exec rake release` to push a new gem.

### Testing with local QPDF builds
If you tinker with QPDF itself, point Bundler to your custom prefix:
```bash
bundle config set --local build.qpdf_ruby "--with-qpdf-include=$HOME/opt/qpdf/include --with-qpdf-lib=$HOME/opt/qpdf/lib"
```

## Roadmap

  TBD

### Code Style
* C++ 17, clangâ€‘format enforced
* Ruby 3.2, rubocop default rules
